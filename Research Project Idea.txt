The demand for cloud data centers is rapidly growing, but their massive energy consumption raises critical questions about sustainability. 
My project idea is to explore how Geographic Information Systems and renewable energy data can guide the placement of future data centers across Europe. 
The idea is to combine spatial datasets on solar photovoltaic potential, wind energy availability, and internet traffic hubs to identify regions that balance two key factors: abundant access to green energy and proximity to major network infrastructure (to minimize latency). 
The end goal is to produce a geospatial analysis and visualization that highlights the most promising locations where cloud providers could sustainably expand their infrastructure.
